/sys/class/leds/input{num}

Here the num maybe change according to your device.
Just do cd /sys/class/leds/ and press tab to find out and change the script.

#bash

I recommended bash script to turn on/off keyboard led on linux. Just run this as sudo to work.
No need to modify the script.
To run this from anywhere your machine **mv /path/to/file /usr/local/bin/name_to_run_as_system**
